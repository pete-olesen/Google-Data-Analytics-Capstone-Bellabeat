# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Bellabeat
The R Studio project for the Google Data Analytics Capstone project.  

This is my first foray into R programming (or really any programming).  I created this as my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certification.

I did this in markdown (an Rmd file) that has the narrative and code in one file. This can be found in the Docs folder. I have also generated (knitted) the html output to this same directory.

I am going to share the html output to my personal website www.peterolesen.com

Thanks!
